# Fake Data Generator

This is a program that creates fake data based on input provided and exports it to a csv in a desired location

## How to Use
1. Download the repo to your local computer
2. Install the required packages found in the `requirements.txt` file
3. Make changes based on what kind of data you want to be generated in the `main.py` file by:
- Changing the data_structure dictionary based on the data type you want in the column (data types can be found as methods in the `FakeDataGenerator` class)
- Changing the file path where the data generated should be saved

## Requirements
Install required packages
```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
